# eXtreme Programming - Dead or Alive

## Book Recommendations

(Recommendations are ordered and come with opinions)

* "Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change" (2nd edition) - ISBN-13: 978-0-321-27865-4
  * The "main" book. Very good theory and motivation on the ideas. 2nd edition has a more refined view compared to 1st, other books in the series were written before 2nd edition.
* "Extreme Programming Applied" - ISBN-13: 978-0201616408
  * Very good practical examples. If you want to read only a second book, this is the one.
* "Extreme Programming Installed" - ISBN-13: 978-0-201-70842-4
  * Smaller than the "Applied" one, it still contains practical examples and insights.
* "Testing Extreme Programming" - ISBN-13: 978-0-321-11355-9
  * A rather big book for a specific role in a multi-functional team. While a more general alternative would be the "Agile Testing" books from Adison&Wesley, this is more geared towards XP "compatibility".
* "Planning Extreme Programming" - ISBN-13: 978-0-201-71091-5
  * Good for starting from almost zero (if you don't even do Scrum). If you are within an agile transformation already, this book brings hardly anything new. Still, it contains pointers for the extra practices.

As a bonus and unrelated to the "series", there's also the "Extreme Programming Pocket Guide" by O'Reilly - ISBN-13: 978-0-596-00485-9 . In style of O'Reilly pocket guides, this one has the bare essentials.

> I, @dertseha, read all these books to verify whether the team I was working in truly "re-discovered" all the practices. And yes, doing all of this does increase your productivity & quality.
> There are more books published as part of the "series", yet not all are available anymore. This might be related to quality, when considering a few reviews on public sites.
