# Continous Integration and Delivery - How do they work and What is out there?

## Legend

* Black items are product alternatives. Lower section contains some build systems.
* Blue items are common features that "good" products would have.
* Green items are various extras or ways these products use.

(Blue/Green is not always cleary separated, all on best guess)

Proximity between products and properties does not express relationship, it essentially became a "cloud of buzzwords" :)
